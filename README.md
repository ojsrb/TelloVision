# DJI/Ryze Tello Computer Vision

It follows whatever tag it sees, that's it right now.
To calibrate, print out an openCV checkerboard, and run main.py and click E while holding the checkerboard in front of the drone's camera (theres a viewfinder), and make sure to get about 20 good pictures. Then you can run calibrate.py and after a few minutes, you're good to go.
